_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
It took me about two days to do the project, I spent a lot of time on cooperating class Place and class Placecollection.
It only take me no more than half an hour to write the kivy file, but the logical thinking on managing the widgets, took me half a day.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I'm satisfied with the appearance of my app most, it took me the shortest time but give me huge sense of accomplishment.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I'm most unsatisfied with my cooperation on the two classes, Place and Placecollection. At first, I have no idea on how to 
use Place in Placecollection, then, I have trouble understanding the function of mark_visited and mark_unvisited in Placecollection.
Writing these two classes took me more than one day.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
The main file's functions work correctly along with kivy file, the validation on name, country, priority works efficiently in my app.
The two classes Place and Placecollection though is tough, but show no bug when running.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I think the cooperation of two classes could be improved and to function well with shorter codes.
For the GUI part, I should use more functions in the two classes instead of writing a whole new code.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
DIY function to use one function multiple times; 
List to store data of the csv file; Class to pack several functions to one class,so as to use those functions in other files; 
Dictionary to store keys and map the name of key with corresponding numbers which are the keys to sort the list of places; 
Kivy language to build an app that is convenient for customer to use.
Itemgetter to sort the list of places in required order.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The most difficult part in this assignment is the logical thinking, to sort the places when choosing one key from spinner, 
I need to clear all places first then create them again in new oder; To do the part where press button to change the status of the place,
I need to locate the pressed button and change it's status then clear all places and sort them again.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
In brief, I found it is challenging to link two classes, but when the link is done, it is smooth and easy to write a pyhton 
file using the exist classes, the code also, will be prettier and shorter.
